/*
*  Constructor that builds the PTree using the provided PNG.
*
*  The PTree represents the sub-image (actually the entire image) from (0,0) to (w-1, h-1) where
*  w-1 and h-1 are the largest valid image coordinates of the original PNG.
*  Each node corresponds to a rectangle of pixels in the original PNG, represented by
*  an (x,y) pair for the upper-left corner of the rectangle, and two unsigned integers for the
*  number of pixels on the width and height dimensions of the rectangular sub-image region the
*  node defines.
*
*  A node's two children correspond to a partition of the node's rectangular region into two
*  equal (or approximately equal) size regions which are either tiled horizontally or vertically.
*
*  If the rectangular region of a node is taller than it is wide, then its two children will divide
*  the region into vertically-tiled sub-regions of equal height:
*  +-------+
*  |   A   |
*  |       |
*  +-------+
*  |   B   |
*  |       |
*  +-------+
*
*  If the rectangular region of a node is wider than it is tall, OR if the region is exactly square,
*  then its two children will divide the region into horizontally-tiled sub-regions of equal width:
*  +-------+-------+
*  |   A   |   B   |
*  |       |       |
*  +-------+-------+
*
*  If any region cannot be divided exactly evenly (e.g. a horizontal division of odd width), then
*  child B will receive the larger half of the two subregions.
*
*  When the tree is fully constructed, each leaf corresponds to a single pixel in the PNG image.
* 
*  For the average colour, this MUST be computed separately over the node's rectangular region.
*  Do NOT simply compute this as a weighted average of the children's averages.
*  The functions defined in hue_utils.h and implemented in hue_utils.cpp will be very useful.
*  Computing the average over many overlapping rectangular regions sounds like it will be
*  inefficient, but as an exercise in theory, think about the asymptotic upper bound on the
*  number of times any given pixel is included in an average calculation.
* 
*  PARAM: im - reference image which will provide pixel data for the constructed tree's leaves
*  POST:  The newly constructed tree contains the PNG's pixel data in each leaf node.
